The problem is : the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain . Now , it seems to me that , despite varying shades of opinion , you all agree that we must remain . When the rebellion first began , there were not even shades of opinion . All the newspapers , even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed . And we were sent here for this very reason . And we are neither madmen nor sadists , gentlemen . Those who call us fascists today , forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance . Those who call us Nazis , do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald . We are soldiers and our only duty is to win .

The salesman never saw him again , but guess who 's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba ? Guy Banister . Banister has someone using the name Oswald to buy the trucks . Hoover , at the FBI , writes a memo dated June , 1960 , that there could be someone using Oswald 's passport and identity .",

For all we know , there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities , countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination .
