Basta , one of the guards , saw the king 's daughter : she was the loveliest of all ! And he immediately fell in love with her . But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king 's daughter ? ! ... One day he managed to meet her and told her he could n't live without her . The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier 'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony , then in the end I 'll be yours . ' Christ , the soldier ran off there and waited ! One day , two days , ten , twenty ... Every night she looked out of her window , but he never budged . Come rain , wind , snow , never budged ! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive ! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he could n't hold them back . He did n't even have the strength to sleep any more . The princess kept watch ... And on the ninety-ninth night , the soldier got up , picked up his chair and left !"

When the rebellion first began , there were not even shades of opinion . All the newspapers , even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed . And we were sent here for this very reason . And we are neither madmen nor sadists , gentlemen . Those who call us fascists today , forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance .
