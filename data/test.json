But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king 's daughter ? ! ... One day he managed to meet her and told her he could n't live without her . The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier 'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony , then in the end I 'll be yours . ' Christ , the soldier ran off there and waited ! One day , two days , ten , twenty ... Every night she looked out of her window , but he never budged . Come rain , wind , snow , never budged ! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive ! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he could n't hold them back .
